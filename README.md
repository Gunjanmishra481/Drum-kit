digiDrum is an interactive web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to play drum sounds using their keyboard. Each key on the keyboard corresponds to a different drum sound, and pressing a key triggers both the sound and a visual animation on the drum kit interface. This project demonstrates the use of event listeners in JavaScript to create engaging and responsive user experiences.
